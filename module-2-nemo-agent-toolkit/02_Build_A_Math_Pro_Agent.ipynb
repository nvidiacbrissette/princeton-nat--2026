    "\n",
    "The NeMo Agent Toolkit supports several types of agents, each with different capabilities and use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ReAct Agent**: Based on the Reasoning + Acting paradigm, this agent performs reasoning between tool calls and can use multiple tools to solve complex problems. It follows an iterative thought process of observation, reasoning, action, and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Calling Agent**: Leverages the native function/tool calling capabilities of modern LLMs. This agent uses tool input schemas to appropriately route requests to the correct tools without requiring explicit reasoning steps between calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reasoning Agent**: Builds on top of an underlying function (like a ReAct or Tool Calling agent) and adds additional reasoning capabilities. This agent type is useful when you need enhanced reasoning on top of another agent's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Agents**: The NeMo Agent Toolkit is pluggable, so you can create or integrate other agentic workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll start with a simple agent, and then we'll be working with a **ReAct Agent** to build our math tools workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a semi-difficult math problem for our agent to attempt to solve."
