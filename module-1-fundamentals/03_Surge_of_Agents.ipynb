    "# The Surge of Agents: A Comprehensive Tour of Modern Agentic Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on exploration of cutting-edge agentic frameworks! In this notebook, we'll dissect the architecture and capabilities of four powerful frameworks that are revolutionizing how we build intelligent systems. Agentic systems—computational entities that can perceive, decide, and act autonomously—represent a paradigm shift in AI development, enabling more sophisticated reasoning, planning, and problem-solving capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a common task—generating and solving mathematical word problems—to showcase each framework's unique approach and strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Python Library**: The foundation of many agentic systems, providing direct access to state-of-the-art language models with a clean, intuitive API. We'll see how even with minimal scaffolding, powerful agents can be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangChain**: A comprehensive toolkit that abstracts away complexity in prompt engineering, output parsing, and workflow composition. We'll explore how it enables structured data handling through Pydantic integration and composable processing chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CrewAI**: A specialized framework for multi-agent orchestration that models complex systems as collaborative teams with distinct roles, goals, and capabilities. We'll examine how it facilitates agent specialization and structured task delegation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: An emerging framework focused on graph-based workflow management that excels at modeling complex, non-linear interaction patterns. We'll demonstrate its power in creating modular, flexible agent architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand the distinctive design philosophies of these frameworks and be equipped to select the right tool for your specific agentic system needs.\n"
