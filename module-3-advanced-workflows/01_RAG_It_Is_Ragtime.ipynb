    "# Building a RAG Workflow with the NeMo Agent Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources. RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based systems with the generative capabilities of LLMs to produce more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How RAG Works\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG operates in three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval**: When a user asks a question, the system searches through a knowledge base to find relevant documents or passages.\n",
    "2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is added to the prompt sent to the LLM.\n",
    "3. **Generation**: The LLM generates a response based on both its pre-trained knowledge and the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced Hallucinations**: By grounding responses in retrieved facts, RAG helps minimize the LLM's tendency to generate plausible but incorrect information.\n",
    "- **Up-to-date Knowledge**: RAG can access information that wasn't available during the LLM's training.\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: RAG allows LLMs to work with specialized knowledge without fine-tuning.\n",
    "- **Transparency**: The retrieved documents provide a source for the information, making the system more explainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG in the NeMo Agent Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "The NeMo Agent Toolkit provides robust support for building RAG workflows through integration with popular frameworks like LlamaIndex and LangChain. In this notebook, we'll build a RAG workflow using the `book_knowledge_rag` tool, which allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ingest and process documents\n",
    "2. Create vector embeddings for efficient retrieval\n",
    "3. Query the knowledge base with natural language\n",
    "4. Evaluate and profile the RAG system's performance\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to:\n",
    "- Configure a RAG workflow in the NeMo Agent Toolkit\n",
    "- Evaluate its performance using standard metrics\n",
    "- Profile and optimize your RAG system\n",
    "- Enhance performance by upgrading components like the LLM"
